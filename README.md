Smart Glove

Display Text and Audio according to the gestures made by the glove.

The GSR (Gesture Recognition System) is the principal part of project. The GSR basically has all the data related to the gestures and their outputs. It uses the data to match the gesture with incoming data and its output. The system tries to match incoming data with existing posture. The bend values of the fingers, combine to make many combinations. Therefore for each posture or a gesture, a specific command or an output is attached. Basically without the GSR, the project won’t function. The code is developed accordingly in the Arduino IDE.
Software simulation of the project is done on Tinkercad.
